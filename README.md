# DashHack Backend Prototype
This is just a basic prototype for [DashHack Backend](http://github.com/HackTrackGlobal/DashHack-Backend).

## Running
First, make sure to have `json-server` installed:
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

Then, go to the project's folder and run:
```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

That's it.
